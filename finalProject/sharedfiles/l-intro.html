<h1>Building Decentralized Systems: Course Introduction</h1>

<h2>Course Overview</h2>

<ul>
<li>	This course is about <i>decentralized systems</i>.
	What is a decentralized system?
<li>	An appealing but simplistic definition is
	<i>a system that works although no one's in charge.</i>
<li>	More precise definitions:
	<ul>
	<li>	<i>Distributed system:</i>
		a system of multiple computers (nodes)
		communicating over a network.
	<li>	<i>Decentralized system:</i>
		a distributed system in which different nodes
		or subsets of the network are owned or controlled
		by different people, organizations, or interests.
	</ul>
<li>	Some illustrative examples:
	<ul>
	<li>	Centralized distributed systems: Google, Yahoo, Facebook.
	<li>	Decentralized distributed systems: E-mail, IRC, BitTorrent, Tor.
	</ul>
<li>	Why study decentralized systems?
	<ul>
	<li>	<b>Direct applicability:</b>
		only a decentralized system can solve computing problems
		in which there is no common authority <i>everyone</i> trusts.
	<li>	<b>Indirect applicability:</b>
		real life is full of decentralized systems &mdash;
		but unlike other relevant fields (econ, soc-sci, pol-sci),
		we get to <i>build</i> and not just <i>study</i> them.
	<li>	<b>Intellectual challenge:</b>
		making decentralized systems work reliably and securely
		is often fundamentally more difficult than centralized systems,
		because we get to make fewer simplifying assumptions &mdash;
		particularly about security.
	</ul>
<li>	Why might we want to build a decentralized system?
	<ul>
	<li>	Sometimes a <b>basic requirement</b>:
		e.g., federated or "business-to-business" systems
		in which there is no natural trusted authority.
	<li>	Decentralized system components/subsets may be more 
		<b>autonomous</b>,
		and hence more <b>available</b> or <b>reliable</b>
		in the face of disconnection or network partition,
		if they aren't dependent on regular communication
		with a central authority.
	<li>	Successful decentralized systems can become
		vibrant, diverse <b>evolutionary ecosystems</b>
		when alternative, competing node implementations
		can coexist and interoperate but evolve independently
		(e.g., IRC clients, P2P clients).
	<li>	This diversity can in turn make a decentralized system
		<b>less vulnerable to attack or infection</b>:
		only a subset of the complete system is likely to be vulnerable
		to any given attack or infection.
	</ul>
<li>	Why might we prefer <i>centralized</i> systems?
	<ul>
	<li>	<b>Management simplicity</b>:
		it's <i>much</i> simpler to manage
		an army of obedient slaves;
		&ldquo;managing&rdquo; a decentralized system
		is akin to herding cats.
	<li>	<b>Security model simplicity</b>:
		a lot of hard security challenges become easy
		when you can just ask a central authority who we assume
		(rightfully or not) to be trustworthy.
	<li>	<b>Efficiency</b>:
		A centralized management and security model can allow for
		simpler and more efficient algorithms,
		less overhead due to crypto, etc.
	<li>	<b>Functionality</b>:
		There are some types of processing that are easy
		on centralized data,
		but which we don't (yet) know how to do at all
		in a decentralized fashion.
		For example, Gmail's spam detection and prevention system
		likely benefits a lot from direct access to the content
		of many users' E-mail accounts.
	<li>	<b>Version compatibility</b>:
		one can limit the number/variety of software versions
		that exist in a centralized system,
		but a decentralized node might have to (try to) interoperate
		with <i>any</i> past, future, or independently developed
		software/hardware combination on another node.
	</ul>
<li>	Course goals:
	<ul>
	<li>	Understand the fundamental challenges 
		inherent in designing and building decentralized systems.
	<li>	Get a feel for the (limited) body of techniques and solutions
		we currently have for meeting these challenges.
	<li>	Examine a number of real, past and present systems,
		how they work, and how and why they succeeded or failed.
	<li>	Solidify this knowledge by applying it to the construction
		of a small, but working and usable, decentralized system.
	</ul>
<li>	Some major general topics and applications we will cover:
	<ul>
	<li>	Communication: messaging, chat, voice/video
	<li>	Decentralized search and data mining facilities
	<li>	Collaboration mechanisms (e.g., wiki)
	<li>	Social networking
	<li>	Deliberation, peer review (voting, reputation systems)
	</ul>
<li>	This course inherently has a heavy security component &mdash;
	which we approach <i>not</i> primarily
	from a formal or cryptographic perspective,
	but from a pragmatic systems perspective.
<li>	Recurrent issues and themes we will see throughout the course:
	<ul>
	<li>	Identity (real, sybil) versus location
	<li>	Information integrity and privacy
	<li>	Behavior accountability
	<li>	Denial-of-service
	<li>	Protocol efficiency,
		in the normal case and under load or attack
	</ul>
</ul>
