<h1>UseNet and Gossip</h1>

<h2> <a href="l-usenet-handout.pdf">Handout</a> </h2>

<h2> Part 1: UseNet</h2>

Before the Internet or Web as we know it,
UseNet was the first successful, mass-scale, decentralized messaging system.

<ul>
<li>	Brief history:
	<ul>
	<li>	1979: Created by Truscott and Ellis.
		<ul>
		<li>	Implemented broadcast via simple gossip scheme
			(see below).
		<li>	Used
			<a href="http://tools.ietf.org/rfc/rfc976.txt">UUCP</a>
			(Unix-to-Unix Copy)
			to propagate "news" messages over dial-up modem links.
		</ul>
	<li>	1981: <a href="http://www.uucp.org/history/uucp-map-1981.html">
		an early UseNet map in hand-drawn ASCII</a>
	<li>	1986:
		As ARPANET/Internet provided widespread always-on connectivity,
		UseNet began shifting to
		<a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc977">NNTP</a>
		(Network News Transfer Protocol)
		to propagate news over TCP connections.
	<li>	1987: <i>The Great Renaming</i> -
		"Big Seven" naming scheme to name newsgroups by subject:
		<tt>comp.*</tt>, <tt>sci.*</tt>, <tt>soc.*</tt>, <tt>rec.*</tt>,
		<tt>talk.*</tt>, <tt>news.*</tt>, <tt>misc.*</tt>.
		Renegade <tt>alt.*</tt> hierarchy developed
		for newsgroups created with no central approval.
	<li>	1990s: Public interest in UseNet peaks,
		then declines quickly.<br>

	</ul>
<li>	How does it work?  It's all in the header.
	<ul>
	<li>	Example USENET message from RFC 1036:
		<pre>
		From: jerry@eagle.ATT.COM (Jerry Schwarz)
		Path: cbosgd!mhuxj!mhuxt!eagle!jerry
		Newsgroups: news.announce
		Subject: Usenet Etiquette -- Please Read
		Message-ID: <642@eagle.ATT.COM>
		Date: Fri, 19 Nov 82 16:14:55 GMT
		Followup-To: news.misc
		Expires: Sat, 1 Jan 83 00:00:00 -0500 
		Organization: AT&T Bell Laboratories, Murray Hill

		The body of the message comes here, after a blank line. 
		</pre>
	<li>	<tt>From:</tt> E-mail address of sender.
	<li>	<tt>Path:</tt> log of message's propagation through network.
	<li>	<tt>Newsgroups:</tt> topic/newsgroup name (or names).
	<li>	<tt>Subject:</tt> message subject, just like in E-mail.
	<li>	<tt>Message-ID:</tt> unique ID of message (duplicate detection)
	</ul>
<li>	Why was UseNet so popular?  A few reasons:
	<ul>
	<li>	It worked, even over slow/intermittent connections.
	<li>	It was decentralized:
		any geek could run his own server,
		connect to others, join the administrative "cabal".
	<li>	It was algorithmically simple:
		could be understood by administrators,
		ported/reimplemented on many different operating systems.
	<li>	It was perceived to be "democratizing" and "censorship-proof".
		<ul>
		<li>	Anyone could post, create a group, etc.
		<li>	(Even after "moderation", "approval" mechanisms added.)
		<li>	Philosophy: "route around attacks,
					route around censorship."
		</ul>
	</ul>
<li>	Why did it collapse?  Spam.
	<ul>
	<li>	Unscrupulous users discovered a free (to them) way
		to bulk-mail a huge audience.
		<ul>
		<li>	<a href="http://groups.google.com/group/sci.stat.edu/msg/8cb0e6b6941bac09">
			First spam January 1994:
			<tt>Global Alert for All: Jesus is Coming Soon</tt></a>
		<li>	<a href="http://groups.google.com/group/alt.pub.coffeehouse.amethyst/msg/477832eb09859797">
			First commercial spam April 1994:
			<tt>Green Card Lottery- Final One?</tt></a>
		</ul>
	<li>	UseNet fell victim of its own success:
		routed everything, <i>including spam</i>,
		around all attempts to control ("censor") spam.
	<li>	Free for anyone to post, no real controls/filters available ->
			signal-to-noise ratio of any popular group
			tends toward zero.
	<li>	People found and moved to alternatives:
		private E-mail lists, Yahoo groups, Facebook, etc.
	<li>	Classic tragedy of the commons,
		with <i>human attention</i>
		being the scarce, overgrazed resource.

<h2> Part 2: Gossip Mechanisms </h2>

UseNet's message distribution mechanism
is an example of a <i>epidemic</i> or <i>gossip</i> algorithm
We now look in more technical detail at this class of algorithms.

<ul>
<li>	Naive approach.
	<ul>
	<li>	On receiving a message,
		re-broadcast it to all neighbors except the one who sent it.
	<li>	Major problem: graph cycles result in forwarding loops.
	</ul>
<li>	Simple but realistic approach (UseNet).
	<ul>
	<li>	Assign each message a <i>unique identifier</i> of some kind.
	<li>	On receiving a message,
		first check ID against database of already-received IDs.
		If already received, ignore new duplicate.
	<li>	Only if message is new, re-broadcast it as above.
	<li>	Advantage: works in the presence of arbitrary loops.
	<li>	Disadvantages:
		<ul>
		<li>	How long do you store IDs of received messages?
			<ul>
			<li>	If forever: database size is unbounded.
			<li>	If limited: how long to store IDs?
				What happens if very-old message gets resent?
			</ul>
		<li>	Well-connected nodes often receive the same message
			many times: waste of network bandwidth.
		</ul>
	<li>	Security challenges:
		<ul>
		<li>	What happens if a node accidentally or deliberately
			chooses message IDs colliding with another node's?
		<li>	What happens if a node changes a message's body
			but leaves its message ID before forwarding?
		<li>	What happens if a node changes a message's ID
			while leaving its body before forwarding?
		<li>	If a node misbehaves, how do you trace that misbehavior?
			(UseNet: record each message's propagation path.)
		</ul>
	</ul>
<li>	Randomized technique: <i>rumor-mongering</i>.
	<ul>
	<li>	Keep database of message IDs received as above.
	<li>	On receiving a <i>new</i> message,
		save its ID in database, then loop:
		<ol>
		<li>	Pick a random neighber (other than source of message).
		<li>	Rebroadcast the message to the chosen neighbor.
		<li>	Neighbor replies indicating whether or not
			it had already seen message.
		<li>	If message was new to neighbor, repeat this loop.
		<li>	If neighbor had already seen message,
			then repeat this loop with some probability
			<i>p</i> &lt; 1,
			otherwise terminate loop.
		</ol>
	<li>	Advantages:
		<ul>
		<li>	Fast: when the rumor is new ("hot"),
			it propagates as quickly as possible:
			exponential fan-out in well-connected network.
		<li>	Efficient: when rumor is old ("cold")
			and most nodes already have it,
			nodes stop resending quickly, wasting little bandwidth.
		</ul>
	<li>	Disadvantage:
		<ul>
		<li>	Unreliable:
			rumor may not spread to <i>all</i> nodes
			before it becomes "cold" everywhere
			and no one is still trying to spread it.
		</ul>
	</ul>
<li>	Another randomized technique: <i>anti-entropy</i>.
	<ul>
	<li>	Independently of when any new message is received,
		each node occasionally (periodically) does the following:
		<ol>
		<li>	Pick a random neighbor.
		<li>	Compare list of message IDs received so far
			with the neighbor's list.
		<li>	For all message IDs one node has received
			and the other hasn't, transfer corresponding message.
		<li>	Result: received message ID databasees
			should be identical.
		</ol>
	<li>	Advantage:
		<ul>
		<li>	Reliable: guarantees that each message
			will <i>eventually</i> propagate to all nodes.
		</ul>
	<li>	Disadvantages:
		<ul>
		<li>	May take substantial bandwidth to compare databases
			<ul>
			<li>	though various optimizations are possible
			</ul>
		<li>	New/rare messages spread slowly.
			<ul>
			<li>	driven only by periodic activities,
				not directly by message arrival.
			</ul>
		</ul>
	</ul>
<li>	Combining rumor-mongering with anti-entropy.
	<ul>
	<li>	Rumor-mongering spreads a hot, new message
		very quickly and efficiently to <i>most</i> nodes.
	<li>	Once <i>most</i> nodes have each message,
		any node that doesn't will get it with high probability
		during its next anti-entropy round.
		<ul>
		<li>	if <i>k</i> out of <i>n</i> nodes
			have the message,
			then a node that doesn't have it will
			pick a node that <i>does</i>
			with probability <i>k/n</i> during anti-entropy.
		</ul>
	<li>	Result: a fast, efficient, reliable algorithm.
		<ul>
		<li>	All nodes guaranteed to receive each message eventually.
		<li>	Messages propagate quickly with high probability.
		<li>	Not too much bandwidth is wasted re-sending messages.
		</ul>
	</ul>
<li>	What about the problems that made UseNet collapse?
	Those are the <i>hard</i> problems,
	left for future lectures!
