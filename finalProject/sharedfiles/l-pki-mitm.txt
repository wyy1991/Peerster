The 3 critical Internet "name-value" mappings:
- DNS name to IP address
- IP address to route/location
- DNS name to security association, e.g., SSL certificates

third is most critical from privacy perspective;
if the third is working, then first two are critical
only from an availability perspective.
(but wherever SSL is not used, first two are critical as well.)

PKI overview
- root cert public keys embedded in web browser
- few Root CAs sign "delegation" certificates declaring
	that other CAs are also trusted to sign server certs
- subsidiary "issuing" CA signs a cert for, e.g., Google servers
- when your browser connects to Google server via SSL,
	the server sends its server-side cert
	and the "chain" of signatures down from the root CA
- if you browser can verify the chain up to a root cert it trusts,
	it silently connects and says all is OK;
	if not, browser warns about an unknown root CA
	(and gives you opportunity to click OK).

Man-in-the-middle attacks
- open source: mitmproxy.org
- commercial: Blue Coat SSL Inspector (formerly Netronome)
- deployment models:
	- "intended" commercial deployment: at a company's firewall
		use custom root CA, but tweak internal web browser to trust
	- Iran's approach in 2011: just use untrusted root cert,
		assume many/most users will click OK to browser warning.
	- More slick (NSA?) approach: subpoena/steal/aquire
		any root or subordinate CA's private key
