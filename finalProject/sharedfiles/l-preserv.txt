Digital Content Preservation


How do you preserve digital content over the long term?

Challenges and threats:

	Physical bit-rot

		CD,s DVDs, hard disks, etc., deteriorate over time

		Hard disks crash

		Machines get fried by power spikes

		Cosmic rays flip bits in memory or
		on the way to or from storage media

	Logical bit-rot

		How do you view/use a document in WordPerfect 1.0 format?

			Current word processing apps probably won't read it

			WordPerfect 1.0 probably won't run on Win XP etc.

		How do you run software written for obsolete machines?

			Can't find the machine anymore

			Even if you can, its I/O is probably incompatible

				10BASE-T coax-based Ethernet?

				Video output to pre-VGA monitors?

				5 1/4" floppy disks?

			Emulators often not be faithful/accurate enough

				"bug-for-bug" compatibility?

				Identical performance?  [games]

	Deliberate attacks

		Rewrite history

		Censor controversial content

		Denial-of-service attacks: suppress availability

		Attrition attacks: undermine maintenance activities
		so that natural/random deterioration takes place

One approach: Stanford LOCKSS (Lots Of Copies Keep Stuff Safe)

	Peer-to-peer system: each "peer" is an institutional library

	Each peer manages a set of Archival Units (AUs)

		e.g., one year's issues of a particular journal

	Peers call regular opinion polls on the contents of an AU

		chooses an "inner circle" of participants randomly
			from a reference list

		only opinions of "inner circle" peers count in poll

		but inner circle participants can suggest "outer circle" peers
		for potential future inclusion in reference list

		poller must expend some "poll effort"
		before other peers will do work on its behalf

			limit DoS attacks by malicious nodes calling polls

		participating peers compute hash tree over stored content,
		compare resulting hashes

		Voters must also expend some effort to cast votes

		Poller classifies votes into invalid, disagreeing, or agreeing

			invalid: indicates fault or malice -
			kick voter out of inner/outer circle & reference list

			agreeing: top-level hashes match

			disagreeing: top-level hashes don't match

		If number of valid votes doesn't reach a quorum Q,
		poller discards results, updates ref list, calls another poll.

		If quorum met:

			If agreeing votes no more than D, "landslide loss".
			Poller's AU is damaged - repairs it.

			If agreeing votes at least V-D, "landslide win".
			Successful check - update ref list, poll again later.

			Intermediate level: inconclusive - raise alarm.

	Effort:

		Poller must expend at least as much effort
		as the cumulative effort it imposes on voters

		Use "memory-bound functions" (MBFs)

			Memory bandwidth is less variable than CPU power

		Timeliness of effort: effort must be recently computed;
		attacker can't precompute and build up over long period

	Inertia, rate-limiting:

		Principle: system should not change quickly
		no matter how much effort is applied to it.

		Prefer for existing friends over new ones

		A peer updates its AU only as a result of polls _it_ called
		(not as a result of other peers' polls)

			Peer controls its own frequency of polls =>
			attacker can't increase rate by causing frequent polls

	Attacks:
		Stealth modification
		Nuisance - cause alarms
		Attrition - prevent repair
		Theft - obtain published content without consent
		Free-loading

Dealing with logical bit-rot

	Document-oriented

		Regularly convert old formats to newer ones

			Advantage: always have stuff in latest format

			Disadvantage: may lose information at each conversion

		Maintain array of converters from old formats to latest ones,
		always convert directly from "original" format

			Advantage: minimize information loss (only 1 step)

			Disadvantage: may require huge number of converters

		VXA: store code to convert from complex formats to simpler ones

	Software-oriented

		Foundation: store entire VMs
